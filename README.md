# Badger Subgraph

The Badger Subgraph repository is a GraphQL based project focused on parsing on chain events into queryable data to enable off chain analysis.
This project is built on top of [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/docs/developer/quick-start) - a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying data from blockchains.

The subgraphs focus on various aspects of the BadgerDAO protocol.
Each subgraph will have a local README detailing the specific data aggregated.
The subgraph project is controlled by a base package defining the shared libraries for standard use across graphs.
Each subgraph is delegated to the subgraphs workspace - this inherits all base packages from the parent package.

## Testing on a Local Graph Node
Open a terminal and run a local blockchain fork for the graph node to connect to:
```
ganache -h 0.0.0.0 --fork https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/***
```

Then in a second terminal, run a local graph node:
```
git clone git@github.com:graphprotocol/graph-node.git
cd graph-node/docker
docker-compose up
```
(might need to `rm -rf data` before running the docker in order to reset ipfs and postgres persistency)

Finally deploy the subgraph in question to the local node:
```
cd src/<subgraph-dir>
yarn codegen && yarn build && yarn create-local && yarn deploy-local
```

## Deploying a Decentralised Subgraph
```
graph auth --studio <api-key>
cd src/<subgraph-dir>
graph codegen && graph build
graph deploy --studio <subgraph-slug>
```
