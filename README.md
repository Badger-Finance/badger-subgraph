# Badger Subgraph

The Badger Subgraph repository is a GraphQL based project focused on parsing on chain events into queryable data to enable off chain analysis.
This project is built on top of [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/docs/developer/quick-start) - a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying data from blockchains.

The subgraphs focus on various aspects of the BadgerDAO protocol.
Each subgraph will have a local README detailing the specific data aggregated.
The subgraph project is controlled by a base package defining the shared libraries for standard use across graphs.
Each subgraph is delegated to the subgraphs workspace - this inherits all base packages from the parent package.

## Deploying a Subgraph

Badger subgraphs are written with the intention of serving cross chain implementations.
Thus, deployment of subgraphs comprises of three steps to allow for this flexibility in cross chain deployments.
